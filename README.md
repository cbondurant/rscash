rscash is my attempt to rewrite GNUcash in a way that works better for me.

No promises that it will be helpful for you.

Explicitly out of scope at this time is any translation or localizaiton, as the rust tools for that seem to be lacking at the moment and I do not have the skills to implement hairy features like that at this time. This handles USD for now.
